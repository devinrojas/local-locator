Question.create(question: "What controller do I play with?", answer: "Anything you'd like! There are plenty of different options. The most common are either a console controller like a Dualsense or Xbox controller, but there are also arcade sticks to mimic the old school feeling of the arcade. There are hundreds of adapters out there if you'd like to play with your own controller. There are professionals who have won major tournaments with custom or retro controllers. The options are endless! If you have any questions on what is 'legal' and what is not in your scene, contact the Tournament Organizers in your area for more information.")
